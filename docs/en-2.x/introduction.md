# Dcat Admin


`Dcat Admin` is a backend system builder based on [laravel-admin](https://www.laravel-admin.org/) that allows you to quickly build a full-featured, high-value backend system with very little code. Supports button click CRUD code generation, built-in rich backend components, out of the box, allowing developers to say goodbye to redundant HTML code, very friendly to back-end developers.
