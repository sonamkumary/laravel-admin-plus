# Actions and form responses

The response methods for [action] (action.md), [data form] (model-form.md), and [tool form] (widgets-form.md) are all the same set of methods.

You can get the `Dcat\Admin\Http\JsonResponse` object in the class by using `$this->response()` and respond to the data to the front end with the

```php
return $this->response()->success('success！');

// equal to
use Dcat\Admin\Admin;
use Dcat\Admin\Http\JsonResponse;

return JsonResponse::make()->success('success！');

return Admin::make()->success('Success!') ;
```

If used in a controller, you need to add the `send` method

```php
public function index()
{
    return JsonResponse::make()->success('成功！')->send();
}
```

### Determine whether to call or not based on conditions

All of the above functional interfaces support the `if` mode, such as the

```php
// If the value of $condition is true, then the refresh method is called
$this->response()->success(...)->ifRefresh($condition);
$this->response()->success(...)->ifLocation($condition, 'auth/users');

// $condition can also be a closure
$this->response()->success(...)->ifRefresh(function () {
    return true;
});
```
